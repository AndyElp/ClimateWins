# Predicting Climate Change Impacts with Machine Learning
### Project Overview:

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze historical climate data and predict future weather patterns in Europe. By understanding past trends we can gain valuable insights into potential climate change impacts.

### Data and Tools:

#### Data Sources:
NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency)
Other meteorological and climate data sources
#### Tools:
Python programming language
Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Data visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### Project Goals:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the structure and quality of the data.
Visualize key trends and patterns in the data.

### Model Selection and Training:
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to predict future weather conditions.
Train and evaluate models using appropriate metrics.

### Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
Assess the performance of the models using validation and testing datasets.
Interpret the model's predictions and insights to inform decision-making.

### Visualization and Communication:
Create visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
Prepare a final report summarizing the project's outcomes and recommendations.
