Using machine learning to investigate weather trends
Cimate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate
change around Europe and, potentially, the world. Itâ€™s been sorting through hurricane predictions
from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., typhoon data
from The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of
other data.
